# Scrum book by Jeff Sutherland
##Chapter 1

The beginning of the book is so interesting! it start by telling the story of the huge failure of the FBI organizing files; more than $500 millon and 10 years spent to update the old and antiquated system that could prevent terrorist attacks and save millions of lives.

The failure was not because they didn't have the right people, technology or resources, the failure was because "the *way* the people were working, the *way* most people work. The way all think work has to be done because that's the way we were taught to do it".

They were using the **"waterfall method"**.

Which is a method from the first World War, it was created in 1910. -> Still being used in the 21st century!

In this cas *"the reports become, more important than the reality they’re supposed to describe, and if there’s a discrepancy, reality is the problem, not the charts"*.

Planning is important, but as Eisenhower once observed "planning for combat is important, but as soon as the first shot is fired, your plans go up in smoke". -> translation: go with the flow. 

### A new way of thinking

Basically to erradicate the problem of ineficciency, budget, and time, it was necessary to create a new way of thinking. This way was called **scrum**. A new way of organizing human endavour.

The term comes from the game of rugby, and it refers to the way a team works together to move the ball down the field. *Careful alignment, unity of purpose, and clarity of goal come together*. It’s the perfect metaphor for what Jeff was looking for.

It was important the fact of how people actually work than how they say they work.

Two very important aspects of scrum **uncertainity** and **creativity**. The Scrum framework harnesses how teams actually work and gives them the tools to self-organize and rapidly improve both speed and quality of work.
