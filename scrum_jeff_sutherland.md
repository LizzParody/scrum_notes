# Scrum book by Jeff Sutherland
##Chapter 1

The beginning of the book is so interesting! it start by telling the story of the huge failure of the FBI organizing files; more than $500 millon and 10 years spent to update the old and antiquated system that could prevent terrorist attacks and save millions of lives.

The failure was not because they didn't have the right people, technology or resources, the failure was because "the *way* the people were working, the *way* most people work. The way all think work has to be done because that's the way we were taught to do it".

They were using the **"waterfall method"**.

Which is a method from the first World War, it was created in 1910. -> Still being used in the 21st century!

This lead to "the reports become, more important than the reality they’re supposed to describe, and if there’s a discrepancy, reality is the problem, not the charts".

Planning is important, but as Eisenhower once observed "planning for combat is important, but as soon as the first shot is fired, your plans go up in smoke". -> translation: go with the flow.
