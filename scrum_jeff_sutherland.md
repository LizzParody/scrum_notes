# Scrum book by Jeff Sutherland
##Chapter 1

The beginning of the book is so interesting! it start by telling the story of the huge failure of the FBI organizing files; more than $500 millon and 10 years spent to update the old and antiquated system that could prevent terrorist attacks and save millions of lives.

The failure was not because they didn't have the right people, technology or resources, the failure was because "the *way* the people were working, the *way* most people work. The way all think work has to be done because that's the way we were taught to do it".

They were using the _"waterfall method"_.
