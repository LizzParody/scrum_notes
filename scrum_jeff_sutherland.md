# Scrum book by Jeff Sutherland
##Chapter 1

The book is so interesting! it start by telling the story of a huge failure of the FBI organizing files... more than $500 millon and 10 years spent to update the old and antiquated system that could prevent terrorist attacks and save millions of lives.

The failure was not because they didn't have the right people, technology or resources, the failure was because "the *way* the people were working, the *way* most people work. The way all think work has to be done because that's the way we were taught to do it".

They were using the **"waterfall method"**.

Which is a method from the first World War, it was created in 1910. -> Still being used in the 21st century!

In this cas *"the reports become, more important than the reality they’re supposed to describe, and if there’s a discrepancy, reality is the problem, not the charts"*.

Planning is important, but as Eisenhower once observed "planning for combat is important, but as soon as the first shot is fired, your plans go up in smoke". -> translation: go with the flow. 

### A new way of thinking

Basically to erradicate the problem of ineficciency, budget, and time, it was necessary to create a new way of thinking. This way was called **scrum**. A new way of organizing human endavour.

The term comes from the game of rugby, and it refers to the way a team works together to move the ball down the field. *Careful alignment, unity of purpose, and clarity of goal come together*. It’s the perfect metaphor for what Jeff was looking for.

It was important the fact of how people actually work than how they say they work.

Two very important aspects of scrum **uncertainity** and **creativity**. The Scrum framework harnesses how teams actually work and gives them the tools to self-organize and rapidly improve both speed and quality of work.

#### “Inspect and Adapt” cycle. 
Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing, review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and how you might do it better. -> requires thought, introspection, honesty, and discipline.

Always ask yourself, what will bring the most value to the project? 80 percent of the value in any piece of software is in
20 percent of the features.

“Agile Manifesto.” It declared the following values: people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what that product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan. Scrum is the framework Jeff built to put those values into practice. There is no methodology.

“I’ll know what the date will be when I see how much the teams improve. How fast they’ll get. How much they’ll accelerate.

It was also crucial, of course, that team members figure out what would stop them from accelerating. As Jeff Johnson put it, “I handled impediment removal.”

production should flow swiftly and calmly throughout the process, and, he said, one of management’s key tasks is to identify and remove impediments to that flow. Everything that stands in the way is waste.
It is not an exaggeration that in a low-growth period such waste is a crime against society more than a business loss. Eliminating waste must be a business’s first objective.Suffice it to say here that the effect of eliminating waste is dramatic, but people often don’t do it, because it requires being honest with themselves and with others.
